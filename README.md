# Caesar-cipher
## Description
With this project you can encrypt and decrypt messages with the caesar cipher. The ceasar cipher substitutes every single letter by rotating every letter in the alphabet for a certain amount of positions. Be aware of the fact the Caesar cipher is extremely unsecure and does not satisfy the requirements for a modern cipher.
